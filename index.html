It has a shade of golden fur.The first time I saw it , I loved it very much.It looked like a soft black ball and was so cute.he was my memorable birthday gift from my cousin!!!I love my pet very much. My parents also love the dog. Very often, I play with Dexter.
My pet dog is my best friend in this world.He is my greatest gift to me!! he brightens my each day with his cute smile and wagging tail.
I love my pet VERY MUCH!</p>

      <h1>PET STORY</h1>
      <p>Having a dog pet is pretty interesting.I have a little puppy as my pet,
I call him  <strong>Dexter</strong> and  He has a shade of golden fur on his body .He runs with his pink tongue out whenever he hears someone calling him.He belongs to the Doberman breed..The first time I saw him ,He looked like a soft black ball and was so cute.He was my memorable birthday gift from my cousin!!!. My parents also love the dog.Dexter is  not only the greatest gift to me but also  my best friend because  theres this connection he has with me that whenever Im stressed he always comes around me and make me play with him.I consider this a way of communicating to me telling me all will be well.He brightens my days with his cute smile and wagging tail.</p>
      <p>I really wish I could show you a photo of the cute dexter but unfortunately dexter is photophobic actually the word is ALLERGIC ..to photos thats the only boring thing about him</p>
      <p>Dexter's  favourite toys include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>moving string</li>
        <li>balls</li>
        <li>dry bone</li>
      </ul>
